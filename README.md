# Project-1

Code for the end of module project for Machine learning in Science.
The data used in this project is the [Wisconsin breast cancer data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Original%29).

The goal of the project is to build an understanding of the difference in features for malignant and benign tumours, 
using unsupervised learning methods, based on the features available in the above data set. This dataset additionally
includes the prognostic and diagnostic associated datasets, however these are not the primary focus of this project.

# Project configuration

- Install the anaconda environment using `conda env create --file ./environment.yml` from the root directory of this
	repository.
